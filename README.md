# Security Scripts & Sources

Welcome to the SecScripts repository! This collection of **security scripts and sources** is designed to assist you in automating various security-related tasks and to list sources that are relavant to security related topics. Whether you're a security professional, a system administrator, or an enthusiast, these scripts aim to simplify your workflow and enhance your efficiency. 

#### Scripts
This repository contains a list with scripts that I use to automate security related tasks. The reason I store them in this repository is organize them in a convienient manner. The advantage of this is that the scripts can be shared with others, so they do not need to reinvent the wheel.

#### Sources
The sources section (below) lists relavant sources which I use for a variety of tasks. Feel free to check them out!

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the security community. If you have a script or sources that you believe would be beneficial to others, feel free to submit a pull request.
