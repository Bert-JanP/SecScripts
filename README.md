# SecScripts

Welcome to the SecScripts repository! This collection of **security scripts** is designed to assist you in automating various security-related tasks. Whether you're a security professional, a system administrator, or an enthusiast, these scripts aim to simplify your workflow and enhance your efficiency. 

This repository contains a list with scripts that I use to automate security related tasks. The reason I store them in this repository is organize them in a convienient manner. The advantage of this is that the scripts can be shared with others, so they do not need to reinvent the wheel.
